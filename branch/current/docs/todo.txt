Artificial Intelligence in host management.  What this actually
  translates to is that the max incoming and outgoing connections will become
  a "suggestion" rather than a hard limit.  The AI will dynamically increase
  and decrease the number of hosts connected based on the goal of maximizing
  the number of hosts seen over the network, taking in consideration of other
  factors such as bandwidth (28.8k, 56k, T1, etc) and network routing
  packets, etc.  Potentially, the AI will be able to keep to the hard limit
  set by the developer.  However, it will always try to find hosts in such a
  way as to increase the number of hosts you're connected to.  I'll have to
  research into this some more, but what this means to you is that you might
  never have to worry about the max incoming/outgoing connections any
  longer.  All the AI needs will most likely be some initial inputs (ie.
  bandwidth) to learn about the network conditions so that it can then begin
  to adapt to it dynamically.
